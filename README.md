Server Setup

Add django-backend files to Digital Ocean django droplet

python manage.py runserver localhost:9000

service gunicorn restart
```

## Build

Direct to call-manager-ios/, and do

```
pod install
open AudioSinkExample.xcworkspace
```

In our skeleton product, we still need to manually add token and username, so after you & your friends fetch the username and token from our backend, you could just compile and user our app to make phone calls. (Will make automatical one further on)
